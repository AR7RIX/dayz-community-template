## üöÄ Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy this Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

**TLDR:** Fork the repo, and [authorize](https://vercel.com/new) Vercel to manage your fork - Done!

## üî® Installation

1. Install [PNpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) on your machine.
    - Windows: `iwr https://get.pnpm.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex`
    - POSIX systems: `curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -`
    - POSIX w/o CURL: `wget -qO- https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -`
2. Download and extract [the latest release](https://github.com/Mirasaki-Development/dayz-community-template/releases) and navigate into the newly created folder.
3. Rename `/.env.example` to `/.env.local` (make sure [file extensions are enabled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5FBLAagPIc) if you're on Windows) and fill in your configuration.
4. Open `/config.ts` and customize the project to your hearts content.
5. Run the following commands in this exact order:

```sh
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the project
pnpm build

# Start the project
pnpm build
```

The project is now available on [port 3000](http://localhost:3000/). This is only available on your local network.

To allow anyone to reach your website, basic knowledge of web-servers (like [Apache](https://apache.org/) or [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/)) is required.

- An example Nginx file is included for your convenience [here](/nginx.example.conf).
- This configuration serves all static assets, if these fail to load (like no styles applied to the website) use the [minimal conf instead](/nginx.min.conf).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The bulk of the configuration is done in the `/config.ts` file. This is a Typescript file, meaning the syntax for this configuration object is very similar to JSON. All keys are meant to be self-explanatory, if you need additional information - head on over to the `/src/lib/config.types.ts` file for explanations.

### Static Files

Static files/assets are served from the `/public` directory. Whenever an image (or other type of local file) is used in the configuration, it's value (the path) is relative to this root `public` directory. That means `/images/logo.png` in the configuration file points to `/public/images/logo.png`.

### CSS and styling

Although simple styling configuration is done in the `/config.ts` file, theme customization can be performed in `/src/app/globals.css`. These are space-separated HSL values.

### Favicon (and other metadata files)

The favicon (browser tab/bookmark icon for pages) can be customized by replacing the source files in `/src/app/favicon.ico`. You can generate these source files from your logo/icon [on this site](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/). Simply upload your logo/icon and click "Download". **Remember** to update the `apple-touch-icon` and `favicon-16x16` images in `/public` as well!

## ‚ùó Common Issues

### ERR_ABORTED

If you're getting `net::ERR_ABORTED 404` errors, that means you have created a new production build but the process listening on your port is still trying to serve previous build files - fix this by restarting your process.
